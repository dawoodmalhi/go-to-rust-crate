# Go To Rust Crate for VS Code

This extension adds a "Rust Open Crate" command for Rust projects in VS Code. It scans all crates installed on your system, allowing you to pick any crate and open it in a new VS Code window. Perfect for quickly navigating and exploring dependencies of a rust project!
